# AirConsole - OverView

## What is AirConsole?

AirConsole is a cloud-based gaming platform that transforms your existing devices into a full video game console. Unlike traditional systems like PlayStation or Xbox, you do not need to buy a physical box or expensive hardware to play. Instead, the platform runs entirely over the internet using equipment you likely already own.

The core concept is simple: your "big screen"-which can be a laptop, a Smart TV, a tablet, or even the infotainment screen in a modern car-displays the game, while your smartphone functions as the controller. This setup makes it uniquely suited for social gatherings, as anyone with a phone can join in instantly without needing extra gamepads.

## How It Works

Setting up a session is designed to be as frictionless as possible. You open the AirConsole website or app on your main display, which generates a short connection code. Players then open the AirConsole app or website on their smartphones and type in that code. The devices sync immediately, turning the phone screens into controllers with buttons, steering wheels, or touchpads specific to the game being played.

Because the smartphone screen is private to the user, the platform allows for unique gameplay mechanics. For example, in a poker game, you can see your cards secretly on your phone while the main table is displayed on the TV.

## The Gaming Experience

The library focuses heavily on "local multiplayer" and casual fun rather than complex, hardcore gaming. With nearly 200 titles available, the selection includes:

- **Party Games:** Quizzes and drawing games similar to Pictionary where everyone competes simultaneously.
- **Racing and Sports:** Mario Kart-style racing games where you tilt your phone to steer.
- **Cooperative Puzzles:** Games where players must shout instructions to one another to defuse bombs or fly spaceships.

The service operates on a "freemium" model. A selection of games is free to play (often with breaks for ads), while a monthly subscription called AirConsole Hero unlocks the full library, removes advertisements, and allows for unlimited players.
