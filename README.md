## Short description

This is an online party game platform where one screen (like your TV or laptop) acts as the console and everyone joins using their phones as controllers. You choose a game from a built‑in library, share the code on the big screen, and friends connect in seconds from their browsers. It's designed to make playing together as simple as opening a website and tapping a few buttons.

## Long description

This project is a web-based party gaming platform that turns any screen with a browser into a game console and every smartphone into a controller. Players open the main site on a TV, laptop, or monitor, which shows a unique room code and simple instructions. Friends then join that room by visiting the site on their phones and entering the code, instantly transforming their devices into custom controllers for the chosen game.  

Once everyone is in, the host can browse a library of casual, easy-to-learn multiplayer games—like quizzes, racing, or quick reaction challenges—and start a session that everyone plays together in real time. The big screen shows the shared action, scores, and progress, while each phone displays personal controls or information that only that player can see. The goal is to make local multiplayer gaming effortless: no consoles to buy, no apps to install, just open a browser and start playing with anyone in the room or on a call.
