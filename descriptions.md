# AirCade - Descriptions

*Create. Play. Share.*

## Tagline

Create, play, and share multiplayer games - right from the browser.

## Short Description

AirCade is a browser-based platform where you build multiplayer games in an integrated code editor and instantly play them on any screen using smartphones as controllers. No consoles, no downloads - just create and play.

## Medium Description

AirCade is a cloud-based platform that combines a creative game studio with an instant-play multiplayer experience. Creators build games directly in the browser using a built-in code editor with p5.js - designing both the shared game screen (displayed on a TV, laptop, or projector) and the controller interface (displayed on each player's phone). Once published, anyone can host a session: guests scan a QR code, their phones become custom controllers, and the group is playing within seconds. With community publishing, remix support, starter templates, and planned expansions into 3D and visual game building, AirCade turns every screen into a console and every phone into a gamepad.
