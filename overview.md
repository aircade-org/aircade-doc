# AirCade - OverView

## What is AirCade?

AirCade is a cloud-based platform that lets you create, share, and play multiplayer games using devices you already own. Unlike traditional game development tools or consoles, you do not need to buy specialized software, expensive hardware, or proprietary controllers. Everything runs in your web browser.

The core concept combines two ideas: a creative studio where anyone can build games, and an instant-play platform where a room full of people can join using their smartphones as controllers. Your "big screen"-a laptop, a Smart TV, a tablet, or even a car's infotainment display-shows the game, while each player's phone becomes a custom controller designed by the game's creator. This makes AirCade uniquely suited for game nights, classrooms, parties, and any situation where a group wants to play together without setup hassle.

## How It Works

### Playing a Game

Joining a session is designed to be as frictionless as possible. The host opens AirCade on their main display, which generates a short Session Code and a QR code. Players then open the AirCade website or app on their smartphones and scan the code or type it in. The devices sync immediately, and each phone transforms into a controller with buttons, joysticks, or touchpads specific to the game being played.

Because the smartphone screen is private to the user, the platform allows for unique gameplay mechanics. For example, in a poker game, you can see your cards secretly on your phone while the shared table is displayed on the TV. In a party game with hidden roles, each player's phone reveals their secret identity without anyone else knowing.

### Creating a Game

AirCade provides a browser-based creative studio with a professional code editor. Creators build two things simultaneously: the Game Screen (what everyone sees on the TV) and the Controller Screen (what each player sees on their phone). Both share the same game state, so a button press on someone's phone instantly affects the action on the big screen.

The platform launches with JavaScript and TypeScript support using the p5.js creative coding library, with plans to add a 3D rendering engine and a visual game builder in the future. Starter templates are provided so new creators can study working examples, modify them, and publish their own versions.

## The Gaming Experience

The library combines community-created games with curated collections, focusing on social and casual fun. Because any creator can publish to the platform, the variety of games grows continuously. Typical categories include:

- **Party Games:** Quizzes, drawing games, and word games where everyone competes or collaborates simultaneously.
- **Racing and Action:** Tilt-to-steer racing games, arena battles, and reflex-based challenges.
- **Strategy and Hidden Roles:** Games where private phone screens enable secret information, bluffing, and deduction.
- **Educational and Custom:** Creator-built experiences for classrooms, team-building workshops, or themed events.

The service operates on a "freemium" model. The creative studio and a selection of community games are free to use (sessions may include brief intermissions), while a subscription called AirCade Pro unlocks the full library, removes intermissions, allows unlimited players, and provides advanced creation tools.
